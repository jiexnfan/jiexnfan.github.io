## 🧮 Stickley Adhesives II — Process Optimization
**Course:** Service Operations Management  
**Tools:** Excel, R, Monte Carlo Simulation  
- Analyzed a global adhesive request workflow across four international sites (Puerto Rico, Wichita, Bangladesh, and the Philippines).  
- Applied **Lean methodology** and **simulation modeling** to minimize labor cost while maintaining process efficiency.  
- Proposed staffing alternatives based on 95% confidence intervals for completed requests.  

📈 *Result:* Improved throughput by 18% and reduced cost by 12%.

## 🏥 Laralex Hospital — Quality Management
**Course:** Six Sigma and Quality Analytics  
**Tools:** Excel, Python, Statistical Process Control  
- Conducted time-series analysis of hospital indicators (infection rate, readmission rate, and cesarean rate).  
- Used **control charts** and **confidence intervals** to identify system-driven variations.  
- Recommended data visualization dashboards for continuous quality improvement.  

📊 *Result:* Enhanced stability and reduced variation in key performance metrics.

## 💻 IMD Help Desk — Queue Simulation
**Course:** Operations Analytics  
**Tools:** R, Queue Theory (M/M/s), Visualization  
- Compared segmented vs. universal IT support systems using queue simulation.  
- Modeled **service time distribution**, **waiting time**, and **utilization rates**.  
- Recommended optimal staffing mix balancing cost and customer experience.  

🕒 *Result:* Reduced average waiting time by 23% with minimal cost increase.
